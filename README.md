# BoggleSolver
Program to demonstrate a dynamic programming method for finding all legal words in a 4x4 Boggle grid.

This package can be integrated with the Boggle repository to enable a computer opponent.
Extra constraints will have to be added because no human can ever beat the scores generated by this.
